It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen" (it's gonna feel so good)
"Just let it happen, let it happen"
<br>
All this running around
Tryin' to cover my shadow
A notion growing insideu
Now all the others seem shallow
<br>
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
Must be a morning
<br>
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
<br>
All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's tryin' to get out
And it's never been closer
<br>
If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
If I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry
<br>
I cannot vanish, you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to push through it
You were not thinking that I will not do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm another story
Take the next ticket, get the next train
Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that
<br>
I cannot vanish, you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to push through it
You were not thinking that I will not do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm another story
Take the next ticket, get the next train
Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that
<br>
Try to get through it, try to push through it
You were not thinking that I will not do it
They be lovin' someone and I'm another story
Take the next ticket, get the next train
Why would I do it? Anyone'd think that
<br>
Baby now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
<br>
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
